**How does the plugin work?**
We run a small AI Agent that collects data relevant to the User’s query using Wordpress Rest APIs and sends it to the Quick Assist Module hosted on  159.223.2.44 which converts the data and sends it to an Open Source LLM hosted on Hugging Face along with predefined system prompts. The response received from the AI model is then sent back to the user via the 3rd party module. During this entire flow of information, none of the user’s personal information is shared with/stored at hugging-face. 

**Privacy Policy**
Quick Assist AI only stores the questions asked by users in the chat. We do not store any other user information like email id, website name, location or any other personal information. The questions stored help us troubleshoot issues and make the plugin better for you.

= Is it Free? Any hidden costs? =
There are no hidden costs or any pro plans. This plugin is built on Open Source models and is free for everyone to use
= How does it work? =
Quick Assist AI  sends the user queries typed in the chat box with a set of instructions to an open source model which then makes a detailed plan, processes it and sends out an output which you see on your chat screen
= Does Quick Assist AI store any users’ information? =
